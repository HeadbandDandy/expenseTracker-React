# expenseTracker-React
This is my implementation of my failed group assignment. Instead of using Handlebars I will be using React to create an expense tracker UI and a more dynamic user interface.



### Next Development

Future Development will contain charts to compare monthly budgets, a login/logout/signup, feature a search option that will allow users to look up pasts transactions. 




#### Future Documentation Necessary to keep up with other applications.
