# expenseTracker-React
This is my implementation of my failed group assignment. Instead of using Handlebars I will be using React to create an expense tracker UI and a more dynamic user interface.


## Build

This application was much easier to build with React as the client-side library was much better at handling dyanmic DOM elements. 


## Deployment 

This application can be deployed at: https://aesthetic-tarsier-b0e4b9.netlify.app/ 



### Next Development

Future Development will contain charts to compare monthly budgets, a login/logout/signup, feature a search option that will allow users to look up pasts transactions. 




#### Future Documentation Necessary to keep up with other applications.
